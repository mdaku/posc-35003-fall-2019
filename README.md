## Course Description & Goals

This course introduces the student to regression analysis for social science inquiry

## Pre-requisites

It is assumed that the student has a basic knowledge of probability, algebra, and inferential statistics, and a cursory knowledge of regression analysis (POSC 20093 or an equivalent should suffice).  

It is also assumed that the student has a basic understanding of R, Stata or SPSS.  Examples in the course will be demonstrated using R, but the student may use the software of their choice to complete their final assignment.

This is NOT an easy course, please be forewarned.
